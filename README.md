# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Originally designed for teams of two, this project focuses on implementing various sorting algorithms in C and understanding their efficiencies using Big O notation. Despite being completed solo, the objective includes learning to select appropriate algorithms based on input size and specific requirements.
